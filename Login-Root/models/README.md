# Models Folder 📂

## Overview 🌟

The **models** folder is responsible for managing the data structure and the interactions with the database. It defines the **UserModel** class, which handles the retrieval and creation of user data in the system. This model is essential for the **Login** and **Register** microservices, as it provides the necessary database operations for user management.

### Role of the **user_model.py** File 📝

The **user_model.py** file defines the methods responsible for interacting with the database regarding user data. It includes operations such as retrieving user information and creating new users. These operations ensure that the necessary data is stored and retrieved securely from the database.

- **find_user()**: This method is responsible for finding a user based on the provided email (and optionally a password). It queries the database to check if the user exists and returns the user's ID if found.
- **create_user()**: This method creates a new user in the database by inserting the provided email and password into the `users` table. It ensures that a new user is added to the system during the registration process.

### Importance of the User Model 🔑

- **Database Abstraction**: The **UserModel** class abstracts the database interactions, allowing the rest of the application to focus on business logic without worrying about SQL queries. This keeps the codebase clean and easier to maintain.
- **User Management**: It is essential for user authentication (login) and registration. By querying the database for the user's credentials and inserting new users, it ensures smooth user flow in the application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The model ensures that database operations are separate from the rest of the application logic. This makes the code more modular, easier to test, and easier to maintain.

### In Summary 📝
The **models** folder contains essential classes for managing user data. The **user_model.py** file handles database operations related to user authentication and registration. By abstracting the database layer, the model improves maintainability and modularity of the codebase.
