# Routes Folder 📂

## Overview 🌟

The **routes** folder defines the URL routes for the application. Specifically, the **login_routes.py** file handles the routes related to user login. It is responsible for mapping the incoming HTTP requests (such as login attempts) to the appropriate functions in the controllers, which will process the request and return a response.

### Role of the **login_routes.py** File 📝

The **login_routes.py** file is essential for defining the **login** route in the application. It sets up the path where users can send their login requests (typically a **POST** request to `/login`). The file uses the Flask **Blueprint** mechanism to organize and modularize the route handling.

- **Blueprint**: The **Blueprint** object is a way to organize routes in a modular way. In this case, **login_bp** is used to define the login route, which is mapped to the `/login` URL path.
- **Route Handler**: The actual logic for handling the login process is delegated to the **login_user()** function in the **controllers/login_controller.py** file. This ensures that the routing logic is separated from the actual business logic of authentication.

### Importance of the Routes File 🔑

- **Separation of Concerns**: The **routes** file is a key part of the separation of concerns pattern. It defines the structure of the application's endpoints but delegates the heavy lifting (such as validating credentials) to the controller and service layers.
- **Modularity**: By organizing routes using Flask Blueprints, the application is modular and can easily be extended. This allows you to add new features (such as additional routes for password recovery, registration, etc.) without cluttering the main application logic.
- **Maintainability**: Keeping the routing logic separate from the rest of the application makes the codebase easier to maintain and scale as the application grows.

### In Summary 📝
The **routes** folder handles the application's URL routes. The **login_routes.py** file defines the login endpoint and delegates the logic to the controller. This structure enhances modularity, maintainability, and scalability, following the best practices of the Flask framework.
