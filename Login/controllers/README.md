# Controllers Folder üìÇ

## Overview üåü

The **controllers** folder is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and delegating the logic to the appropriate services. The **login_controller.py** file is specifically responsible for handling login requests for users. It processes the user's input (email and password) and then calls the **AuthService** to validate and authenticate the user.

### Role of the **login_controller.py** File üìù

- **Request Handling**: The **login_controller.py** file listens for incoming requests to log users into the system. It extracts the email and password from the request payload and sends them to the **AuthService** for validation.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The **controller** in this architecture is primarily concerned with receiving the user input, handling HTTP-specific logic (such as reading request data), and passing it to the **service** layer for business logic execution. This follows the **Separation of Concerns** principle, making the code modular and maintainable.
- **Delegation to AuthService**: Once the input is extracted, the controller delegates the task of authentication to the **AuthService**, ensuring that the logic for authenticating users is isolated in the service layer. This allows for easier modifications and testing of authentication logic without affecting the controller.

### Why This Folder Is Important üîë

- **Controller-Service Layering**: By separating the controller and service layers, this structure promotes a clean and maintainable codebase. Controllers handle HTTP-related logic while services handle business logic, ensuring that each part of the application has a single responsibility.
- **Modularity**: The controller can be extended to handle different types of user interactions (e.g., login attempts, password resets) while keeping the authentication logic in the service layer.
- **Error Handling**: The controller also handles potential errors related to invalid requests or authentication issues, ensuring that users receive informative responses when something goes wrong.

### In Summary üìù
The **controllers** folder manages HTTP requests and communicates with services to execute business logic. The **login_controller.py** file is responsible for handling user login requests, delegating authentication to the **AuthService**. This clear separation of concerns makes the application easy to maintain and extend.
