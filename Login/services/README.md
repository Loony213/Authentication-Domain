# Services Folder 📂

## Overview 🌟

The **services** folder contains the core business logic of the application. Specifically, the **auth_service.py** file handles the authentication operations, such as logging in and registering users. This service interacts with the **UserModel** to validate credentials, generate JWT tokens, and handle the registration process.

### Role of the **auth_service.py** File 📝

The **auth_service.py** file provides the authentication logic required for user login and registration. It manages the process of checking the user's credentials, generating a secure JWT token, and verifying the uniqueness of email addresses during registration.

- **login_user()**: This method takes the user's email and password, checks them against the database, and if valid, generates a JWT token to authenticate the user. If the credentials are invalid, it returns an error response.
- **register_user()**: This method registers a new user by checking if the email is already registered in the database. If the email is not already taken, it creates a new user and returns a success message. If the email is already registered, it returns an error message.

### Importance of the Auth Service 🔑

- **Authentication**: The service is crucial for validating user identities and securely managing access to the application. By using JWT tokens, it ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- **Security**: By using JWT tokens and encrypting user credentials, the service ensures the security and privacy of user data. This is important to prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The authentication logic is encapsulated in this service, ensuring that the business logic (such as validating credentials and generating tokens) is separate from the routing and controller logic. This modular approach keeps the application clean and maintainable.

### In Summary 📝
The **services** folder encapsulates the application's business logic. The **auth_service.py** file is responsible for user authentication, including login, registration, and token generation. This service ensures security, separation of concerns, and a modular structure for the application.
